# Weather App

## Usage 
This application fetchs data from the OpenWeather API.
By typing a location in the search inputs it returns various current weather data for that location. 
The second location box is to specify a country, for example Birmingham, UK and Birmingham, US.

## TO-DO

In future version I am wanting to add additonal functionality. 

- Mobile responsiveness, using media-width queries.
- Use JQuery :contains and a switch statement to dynamically edit the css so a different background image is present for each type of weather cloud, sun, rain, snow.
- Using JQuery, hide the displayWeather <div> if no search has been entered. 
- Connect a back-end to the application using MongoDB to save each search and display the result cards in a carousel.
- Using a library like leaflet.js to add maps to the result card.
